                    <p>In Norbert Wiener’s 1950 book <i>The Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society</i>, he
                        talks
                        about the Western worship of progress despite the entropic nature of the universe – the natural
                        tendency towards disorder and decay – ultimately leading to a static state of uniformity where
                        nothing interesting will ever happen again: heat death. Weiner observes reactions contrary to
                        these
                        conditions:</p>
                    <blockquote>Nevertheless, [man] tries to relegate these unfortunate realities to the role of
                        accidents,
                        and to build up a Heaven on Earth in which unpleasantness has no place. This Heaven on Earth
                        consists for him in an eternal progress, and continual ascent to Bigger and Better Things.
                    </blockquote>
                    <p>Today, we continue with this kind of progress. Driven towards immortality at the expense of our
                        environment, we hasten our delivery unto extinction. We organise ourselves into pockets of order
                        and
                        furnish our daily existence with narratives and ideologies designed to maintain stability. These
                        stories are a kind of homeostasis for our inadequacy to deal with a harsh and indifferent
                        habitat.
                        We dedicate ourselves to our own annihilation. This work investigates the disparity between our
                        scientific understanding of the world and these narratives.</p>
                    <p>Such focus on our own progress and order is a narrow, short-sighted one, perpetuating an idea of
                        humanity as separate and estranged from nature, attempting to dominate and assert control. With
                        every physical process committed, a portion of energy is rendered useless, increasing entropy.
                        The
                        more we populate the planet the more we stimulate chaos and decay.</p>

                The metaphor to which I devote this chapter is one in which the organism is seen as message. Organism is
                opposed to chaos, to disintegration, to death, as message is to noise. To describe an organism, we do
                not try to specify each molecule in it, and catalogue it bit by bit, but rather to answer certain
                questions about it which reveal its pattern: a pattern which is more significant and less probable as
                the organism becomes, so to speak, more fully an organism.
                We have already seen that certain organisms, such as man, tend for a time to maintain and often even to
                increase the level of their organization, as a local enclave in the general stream of increasing
                entropy, of increasing chaos and de-differentiation. Life is an island here and now in a dying world.
                The process by which we living beings resist the general stream of corruption and decay is known as
                <i>homeostasis</i>.
                We can continue to live in the very special environment which we carry forward with us only until we
                begin to decay more quickly than we can reconstitute ourselves. Then we die. If our bodily temperature
                rises or sinks one degree from its normal level of 98.6° Fahrenheit, we begin to take notice of it, and
                if it rises or sinks ten degrees, we are all but sure to die. The
                oxygen and carbon dioxide and salt in our blood, the hormones flowing from our ductless glands, are all
                regulated by mechanisms which tend to resist any untoward changes in their levels. These mechanisms
                constitute what is known as homeostasis, and are negative feedback mechanisms of a type that we may find
                exemplified in mechanical automata.
                It is the pattern maintained by this homeostasis, which is the touchstone of our personal identity. Our
                tissues change as we live: the food we eat and the air we breathe become flesh of our flesh and bone of
                our bone, and the momentary elements of our flesh and bone pass out of our body every day with our
                excreta. We are but whirlpools in a river of ever-flowing water. We are not stuff that abides, but
                patterns that perpetuate themselves.
                A pattern is a message, and may be transmitted as a message. How else do we employ our radio than to
                transmit patterns of sound, and our television set than to transmit patterns of light? It is amusing as
                well as instructive to consider what would happen if we were to transmit the whole pattern of the human
                body, of the human brain with its memories and cross connections, so that a hypothetical receiving
                instrument could re-embody these messages in appropriate matter, capable of continuing the processes
                already in the body and the mind, and of maintaining the integrity needed for this continuation by a
                process of homeostasis.
